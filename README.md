# Codemodder Specificiations

Codemodder is a framework for developing codemods. There are implementations in different languages, because the tools for providing context and code manipulation are likely to be written in a given language. There is intended to be tight specification alignment across different languages to ensure a similar experience and prevent language teams from running into already-solved problems.

This repository is intended to hold specifications, guidance, and facilitate alignment across languages.
