# Codemodder Specificiations

Codemodder is a framework for developing codemods. There are implementations in different languages, because the best tools for providing context and performing code manipulation are likely to be written in a given language. There is intended to be tight specification alignment across different languages to ensure a similar experience and help new language teams avoid running into already-solved problems.

This repository is intended to hold those specifications and supporting guidance.
